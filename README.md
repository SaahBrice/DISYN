   git clone https://github.com/saahbrice/disyn.git
   cd disyn
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Frontend Setup** 

   Tailwind CSS

   ```bash
   pip install tailwindcss
   ```

5. **Apply Migrations**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
